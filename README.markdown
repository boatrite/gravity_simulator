# Gravity simulator

Test project for fun

Fixme
* Tails should start at edge of circle, not center

ToDo/Ideas
* Add Please.js for better random colors
* When paused, show arrow indicating direction? Make it dragable to change velocity?
* Copy entity link
* Better layout/styling
* Merge entities that collide (Instead of having them shoot off to infinity)

Future
* Real values? Decide on a suitable scale (how many meters per pixel?)
* Benchmark and try optimize entity paths (not as important as force optimization)
* Click and drag to view more space (infinite size?)
* Predefined entities (our sun, earth, planets, black holes?, other types of stars?)
* Predefined setups (sun earth moon, dual star, solar system?, 3 body, etc)
* Remove entities way too far off screen
