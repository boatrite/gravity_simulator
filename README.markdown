Gravity simulator.

Built with
* coffeescript

Fixme
* There's bug with force calculation when a third body is added

ToDo/Ideas
* When paused, show arrow indicating direction? Make it dragable to change velocity?
* On new entity being added, add property fields to dom so they can be changed
* Make it so you can add entities while the thing is paused (and then change their values)
* Predefined setups (sun earth moon, dual star, solar system?, 3 body, etc)
* Tails should start at edge of circle, not center
* Use slim instead of plain html?
* Predefined entities (our sun, earth, planets, black holes?, other types of stars?)
* Change canvas height, width with inputs
